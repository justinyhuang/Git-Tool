          <p>Git, though powerful and popular, in most cases is too complicated to use. The command set is huge,
the parameters are too many, the design is sophisticated and hense the learning period is too long.
For some one who wants only a tool to manage his/her source code or document, to master Git and
make it work requires too much learning.
(I bet most of the Git users keep a ProGit or something similar on hand)
I have many questions since using Git:
    Why use different command for similar requests?
    Why type long command + parameters when the requirement is simple?
    What is 'stage' and why one has to understand this when all needed is to back up my changes?</p>

<p>This is why GitTool is here.
GitTool tries to simplify the use of git providing simple yet powerful interfaces to the user.
GitTool learns Git so you don't have to =)</p>

<p>TARGET USER
GitTool is specialized for those who need to use git everyday but don't like to master the tool.
These users only need git to help managing changes of their work, as well as communicating with
others via Git. Spending time to know 1001 ways of using git is unacceptable for them.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Easy, short yet powerful commands. In most cases a GitTool command varies from 3 to 5 characters
Very few arguments are required. Some examples are given below as comparison: (what Git command
will need to accomplish the same task?)</p>

<p>To show changed but not commited files
GitTool Command: gst</p>

<p>To show changed files between working copy and the remote tracked branch
GitTool Command: gstr</p>

<p>To show changed files between working copy and version/branch xxx
GitTool Command: gst xxx</p>

<p>To check the logs of latest 3 commits
GitTool Command: gls 3</p>

<p>To check the logs of latest 3 commits, in a graphical version tree
GitTool Command: glsg 3</p>

<p>To do a diff of the changed files between version xxx and yyy
GitTool Command: gdi xxx..yyy</p>

<p>To do a diff with vimdiff in a remote-connection, and meld in a local workstation, and bc3 when
someone like to see it in bcompare
GitTool Command: gdi/gdi2/gdi3</p>

<ul>
<li>tools used in gdi/gdi2/gdi3 are set during installation of the tool</li>
</ul>
<p>and many other use cases....</p>
</li>
<li><p>Graphic git history presentation. A slightly better graphical presentation compared to those by other tools like gitk.
For example, to show a graphical version tree of the last 10 nodes, 'gifg 10' will show you the graph.
Powered by Graphviz and qiv.</p></li>
<li><p>Iterative mode. In many cases you will be give a list of branches/changed files/repositories.
You can manipulate branches/files/repositories easily with a few key strokes.</p></li>
<li><p>View configuration similar to ClearCase. GitTool provides a means to select files from different commits/versions, yet with some version control capabilities. [to be implemented]</p></li>
</ul><p>INSTALL
"Why do I need to install?"
GitTool works in a way similar to 'busybox'. That is, many symbolic links pointed to
the same executable. It needs to know your bin directory to put the symbolic link
files. GitTool have to backup your .gitconfig file before adding GitTool specific
settings later. It also will ask for your preference to using the tool after setup,
for example your choices of diff tools.</p>

<p>Installing GitTool is simple. Just run 'git_tool_box.py' directly and answer
the questions along the setup process. The tool will setup itself and ready for use.</p>

<p>COLORED TEXT
During the setup process, GitTool asks if colored text is supported in your environment,
with an example of colored text. We recommend saying yes, as many GitTool features
depend on the ability to show texts in different colors.</p>

<p>PROMPT MODE
There are many cases where you will be asked for choices or answers when GitTool shows
a line and waits for your input with a prompt (by default it is a ':&gt;' sign). This is
called the Prompt Mode in GitTool.
GitTool enters the Prompt Mode when user intervention is required, and it tries to ask
questions in the shortest way. Because as you use the tool, you become familiar with
what it is asking. For new users, one can always try the</p>

<p><em>help command</em>
   When in Prompt Mode, type '\h' to get help messages if there is any. In you have
   colored text enabled when setting up GitTool, there is an easy way to tell if help
   message is available:
   There is help messages if the prompt sign changes color.(default color with help is
   light blue)</p>

<p>Or if you decide to quit instead of answering the question, use the</p>

<p><em>exit command</em>
   When in Prompt Mode, type '\e' to safely exiting GitTool.</p>

<p>There is yet another command that is useful in use cases like being shown a list of
branches and you would like to delete one of them. That is the</p>

<p><em>delete command</em>
   When in the Prompt Mode and a lost of items are shown, type '\d' followed by the index
   of the item to delete it, no matter what the item is: a branch, a history entry or
   a file shown in a diff-file list (Right! That could be 'git checkout', or 'git reset',
   or whatever effort you would pay to reverse a change you made to a file)</p>

<p>HOWTO GET HELP
After installation, 'ghelp' will show you a list of available services with a brief
description. Use 'ghelp ' for detailed information of the corresponding command.
You can also put a '?' after the command to get the help message, which is equal to
'ghelp '</p>

<p>I DONT LIKE IT
'git_tool_box.py clean' will help you remove GitTool and recover your .gitconfig file.
After that 'rm -fr </p>' and you won't see GitTool anymore.

<p>But...why?</p>
